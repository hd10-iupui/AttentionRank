AttentionRank: Unsupervised keyphrase Extraction using Self and Cross Attentions

Keyword or keyphrase extraction is to identify words or phrases presenting the main topics of a document. We proposes the AttentionRank to identify keyphrase from a document in an unsupervised manner. AttentionRank calculates self-attention and cross-attention using a pre-trained language model. The self-attention is designed to determine the importance of a candidate within the context of a sentence. The cross-attention is to identify the semantic relevance between a candidate and other sentences.
